        single use items, and minimise packaging waste by choosing products
        with minimal or biodegradable packing. It also put one to the task of
        using reusable bags, containers and waterbottles by keeping them handy
        and incoperating them into dail use. Not forgeting the process of properly
        sorting and processing recyclable material by checking recycling guidelines
        and separating materials correctly.

        native trees by selecting suitable sites and caring for seedilings 
        an easy practice known as afforestation. One is also requried to rebuild 
        ecosystems by removing invasive species and restoring natural processes.
        Urban Greening by creating parks and working with local communities to
        design and maintain green spaces is also vital for environmental conservation.
